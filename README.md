##BACKGROUND

Currently, to write up a report on businesses, an individual must manually go investigate documents and to record it in a spreadsheet. From the spreadsheet, the individual can create a report. This is highly inefficient as the number of businesses continue to grow.

##PURPOSE

This web application is designed to be a business management system, where it keeps track of a business's basic and financial information, the goals and skills of individuals who work at the business, the founder's origin and ideas, and the events a business is hosting/attending. Having access to all this information would help save time in writing reports and help further improve research within the Cybersecurity lab.

##SCOPE

This business management system is a full stack web application that will be developed using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap4, and JavaScript for the frontend, and Python and MySQL for the backend. The goal of this web application is to help save time in writing reports and help further improve research within the Cybersecurity lab.

In our software, certain access is granted based on what you are classified as: administrator, founder, or employee. Given the user is the administrator, who has access to everything, the application can quickly access any business’s record, user's record and report.
